# Space_Invaders
Second game I ever made, just to learn how to code. It's a copy of the game Space Invaders. Sometime 2020/2019. 

### space_attack.py
1. Install dependencies in requirements.txt
2. Ensure all images and sounds are in the same folder
3. Run space_attack.py to start. Press enter to shoot, use mouse keys for horizontal movement
4. The game increases in dificulty over time, you lose if an enemy passes you.

### Images and sounds
I found them on some "free stock image" website. They are not mine, and I do not share them as individual items.
